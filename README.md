## Social Media App for DACS Opportunity

Cheapo Software Solutions is a company that specializes in market 'opportunities' in the software sector. They have just spotted one such opportunity. DACS (read as DAACKS or ducks ðŸ¦†) is looking for software to allow students to share images with each other, similar to Instagram. They want a system that has all the usual image sharing application functionalities (allow users to create profile, post images, like images and follow other users), and has a nice GUI feel to it (Java Swing or FX).

At the core of this app is the feature that allows users to set up and personalize their profiles. Users sign up, log in, and add a personal touch to their profiles with photos and bios, similar to what they would do on Instagram. Following profile setup, users can begin sharing snapshots of their lives by uploading images with captions and (optionally) tags. The system is designed to handle a variety of image formats, ensuring every shared moment is displayed in its best light.

Interaction is a crucial part of the experience. Users can explore new posts, connect with peers through following and messaging, and interact with posts through likes and comments. The Explore feature enables users to discover trending content and new profiles, encouraging them to engage with fresh and interesting posts. Real-time notifications keep users updated on new interactions, ensuring they're always in the loop.

But it's not all just socializing and sharing; the application should also prioritize a safe and orderly environment. Admin users play a crucial role here, with special privileges to moderate content and address user concerns. All user data, including posts, comments, and likes, are managed and stored with care, ensuring both integrity and a seamless user experience.

DACS has their own database where they securely store all the images, user information and application related metadata. This database is not part of the specification for this project. Instead, the application has to load up a number of "txt" files that is stores all the app related data.

The 'opportunity' that Cheapo Solutions perceives is that it has found some software in a university course material. This software is written in Java and is appropriately called "Quakstagram". It already has much of the functionality that the DACS want. Cheapo Solutions thinks that they will be able to adapt this existing system to their needs and reap the huge reward (â‚¬80,000) that the DACS is willing to offer.

You have just been taken on by Cheapo Solutions (being paid a miserable 30% of your BCS1430 module /annum) and they have tasked you with adapting the Quakstagram system to the needs of the DACS. You have over 7 weeks to achieve this. Specifically your job is to
